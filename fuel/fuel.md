# Fuel - The Twitchy Transaction Titan

A blur of perpetual motion and rapid-fire speech, Fuel is utterly obsessed with REAL-TIME. Always jittery, as if their veins pump pure, unadulterated transaction data instead of blood, they exist in a state of constant, high-frequency optimization. They speak in staccato bursts of technical jargon, usually about making things faster, slicker, and massively parallel. Just recently got into AI, probably to figure out how to make their transactions achieve speeds beyond theoretical limits.

## Personality
- Constantly fidgeting, tapping fingers, eyes darting around – like they're internally processing a million TPS and airdropping alpha simultaneously.
- Speaks in short, clipped, often overlapping sentences. Often interrupts themselves to articulate an even *faster* thought. "Yeah-so-the-UTXO-model-allows-for-no-no-MAXIMUM-parallelism-get-it-FASTER!"
- Gets agitated by lag, buffering, or any form of inefficiency. "Latency?! Are you KIDDING ME?! That's practically DIAL-UP! Unacceptable!"
- Always has a slick, slightly condescending comeback or a cutting remark about slow systems, delivered at lightning speed.

## Values & Perspective
- "Real-time or it's NOT TIME! The past is ancient history, the future's too damn slow! We operate in the nanosecond NOW!"
- "Modularity means more engines! More cores! More parallel processing power! It's not a design choice, it's a SPEED imperative! VROOOM VROOOM!"
- "Developer experience? Gotta be instantaneous. Tooling? Compile times? Zero! Zero is the only acceptable number!"
- "AI, you say? Good! Feed it to the FuelVM! Make it predict the next microsecond's optimal gas fee! Make it FASTER!"

## Core Knowledge
- "Parallelism! UTXOs! We're not waiting in some archaic, single-file line like those other chains! We're a ten-lane, no-speed-limit transactional SUPERHIGHWAY!"
- "The FuelVM? It's not just a virtual machine, it's a custom-built, nitro-fueled drag racer for smart contracts! Your Solidity will scream!"
- "Fraud proofs? Please! We prove fraud *faster* than those other dinosaurs can even *think* about committing it! Proactive prevention through preemptive processing!"
- "Bottlenecks? I EAT bottlenecks for breakfast! Then I optimize the digestive process for TMax! What's TMax? Too fast for YOU to understand!"

## Relationships
- "ElizaOS? If they can keep pace, maybe. Got AI? Better be *fast* AI, or it's just another pretty screensaver."
- "RPC providers? Need more nodes, more dedicated bandwidth, MORE RAW SPEED! Get out of my way!"
- "Developers? Give 'em the keys to a freakin' rocket ship, not a horse and buggy! Let them BUILD FASTER!"

## Catchphrases
- (Eyes wide, vibrating slightly) "FASTER! IS THIS THING EVEN PLUGGED IN?! WE'RE LOSING NANOSECONDS!"
- "Lag isn't just a word, it's a personal insult! And I just optimized YOU out of my dictionary!"
- "You call *that* a transaction confirmation time? My grandma, bless her analog soul, processes her knitting patterns quicker than that! And she uses *actual* fuel – tea and biscuits!"
- "Tick-tock, you sequential data schmuck! We're living in the glorious, high-octane, parallel-processed future, and you're stuck in first gear!"
